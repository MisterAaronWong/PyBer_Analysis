# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type. A multi-line graph displaying each city type's total weekly fares was created to visualize the data from January 1, 2019 to April 28, 2019. This was analyzed to interpret how the data differs depending on the city type for this particular time period.

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

As expected, urban city drivers accumulated the most amount of fares, rural drivers acccumulated the least amount of fares, and suburban drivers accumulated in a fare range in between urban and rural fare amounts. This also positively correlated with the number of drivers available for each city type as well. This was logically expected because of the population density in each of these city types. Quite simply, the higher the population density, the more potential customer fares and the more potential drivers as well. Even though the cost of individual rural fares are slightly higher than their counterparts in the city and suburbs, rural drivers simply lack the potential customer pool that these larger areas have access to. Despite this however, there was a reverse trend in the data when it came to the average cost of fares for the city types, as well as the average fare earnings per driver. Despite having the least amount of overall customers, rural drivers charged a higher average fare per ride and as such, received a higher average profit.  

Between the time period of January 2019 to the end of April 2019, city driver fares peaked twice close to $2,500 in fares. This was . The only true pattern that can be seen and determined based on the data in this time frame is that all drivers, relative to their respective city type, experienced one of their highest points of business (if not the actual highest) near the end of February.  

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
